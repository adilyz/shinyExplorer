# shinyExplorer
A shiny app for data exploration

This application is written for automizing data exploration. The app loads R's datasets library and user can select any data set for exploration.

It is possible to load a data set from local disk to the application and perform the basic exploration needs, as well. 

I think this can be a good starting point for any kind of data analysis process. 

The app needs improvements and i will try to do more when i find time. 

E.g. the app works well on Rstudio but there are some errors in plotting section when run in shinyapps.io site...
